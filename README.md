# API-Made-Simple

**API-Made-Simple** is a standalone desktop application designed for frontend developers to seamlessly mimic API interactions during development. Unlike traditional API testing tools, API-Made-Simple allows users to define custom API routes, HTTP methods, and mock responses for both successful and failed callsâ€”without requiring a live backend server. This enables developers to continue frontend development even when backend services are incomplete or undergoing maintenance.

With an intuitive UI for configuring endpoints and responses, API-Made-Simple acts as a local mock server, intercepting API requests from frontend applications and returning predefined JSON data. This allows for rapid prototyping, error simulation, and isolated frontend testing, drastically reducing development bottlenecks.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Routes:** Define any API endpoint with support for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.
- **User-Defined Responses:** Configure both *success* and *failure* responses to match expected backend behavior.
- **Instant Feedback:** API requests are instantly processed, providing immediate feedback for frontend components.
- **Seamless Integration:** Acts as a drop-in replacement for backend servers during local development.

API-Made-Simple empowers frontend developers with the flexibility to build and test their applications without waiting for backend dependencies, accelerating the development cycle and enhancing productivity.
